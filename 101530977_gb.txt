George Brown College is a public, fully accredited college of applied arts and technology with 
three campuses in downtown Toronto. Like many other colleges in Ontario, George Brown College was chartered
in 1966 by the government of Ontario and opened the next year.

George Brown has three campuses located in Downtown Toronto. For our purposes, the
School of Computer Technology is located in the Casa Loma Campus. Other programs offered within the
Casa Loma campus are in the School of Fashion & Jewellery and the School of Media and Performing
Arts.

The other two campuses, St. James and Waterfront, offer other varied programs and specialities. 
The St. James campus is home to the Centre for Business and the Centre for Hospitality & Culinary
Arts, for instance. The Waterfront campus is home to the School of Dental Health, Health Services 
Management, and the School of Health & Wellness.
