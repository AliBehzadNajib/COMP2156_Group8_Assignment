Learning DevOps in the software development cycle is incredibly important due to the advantages
it brings to both the development and operations processes. It greatly improves the collaboration
between development and operations.

It also contributes to greater efficiency in the development process especially as it relates
to continuous testing, deployment, and monitoring.

By maintaining this commitment to efficiency, DevOps engineers can help teams deliver software
updates more rapidly and reliably, reducing time to market.
