This group project relates to the COMP 2156 curriculum, DevOps for System
Administration. COMP 2156 is an instructional course going through the procedures,
protocols, and best practices for a DevOps engineer career. 

The course aims to teach students how to effectively carry out the roles of a 
System or Network engineer with DevOps processes. Learners will also be able to
demonstrate strategies and skills of using DevOps tools, Cloud database technologies
and techniques for software/network applications.

For the first half of the semester, we covered CI/CD tools and Web Server and Web Hosting, as
well as an introduction to build tools.

Following the mid-term we will be working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps automation, and 
going into the market demand for a DevOps engineer.
